# AI & ML Internship – Task 1  
## Understanding Dataset & Data Types

### 📌 Overview
This repository contains the implementation and analysis for **Task 1** of the AI & ML Internship.  
The main objective of this task is to understand the dataset structure, identify data types, check data quality issues, and evaluate the dataset’s suitability for machine learning.

---

### 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook

---

### 📁 Dataset Used
- Titanic Dataset  
  *(Alternatively, Students Performance Dataset can be used)*

---

### 🔍 Task Objectives
- Load the dataset and explore its structure
- Identify numerical, categorical, ordinal, and binary features
- Analyze missing values and duplicate rows
- Check data imbalance in the target variable
- Verify and correct data types
- Determine the target variable and input features
- Evaluate dataset readiness for machine learning

---

### 🧪 Steps Performed

1. Imported required Python libraries and loaded the dataset using Pandas
2. Displayed first and last few rows to understand data structure
3. Identified categorical and numerical columns
4. Checked unique values in categorical columns
5. Detected missing values and duplicate records
6. Analyzed class distribution for data imbalance
7. Verified column data types using `df.info()`
8. Documented observations on data quality issues

---

### 📊 Key Observations
- Certain columns contain missing values that require preprocessing
- Duplicate rows were checked to ensure data consistency
- The target variable shows class imbalance
- Some features require data type conversion before modeling

---

### 📈 Final Outcome
After completing this task, the dataset structure and quality were clearly understood, and the dataset was evaluated for machine learning readiness.

---

### 📎 Files Included
- Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) – Complete analysis and code
- Dataset file (`.csv`)
- README.md – Task explanation and summary

---

### ✅ Conclusion
This task provided hands-on experience in data exploration and preprocessing, which are critical steps before building any machine learning model.
